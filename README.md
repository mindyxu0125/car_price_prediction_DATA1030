Machine Learning Regression Problem: Used Car Price Prediction

The dataset was from Kaggle. The link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/car-price-prediction-dataset/data. You are free to use my code as it can directly load the data without downloading it.

This code aims to predict the price using machine learning using this dataset.

First, load the data, and follow the EDA.

Then do the data cleaning.

Then I created a pipeline to fit with five ML algorithms: Linear Regression, KNN, RandomForest, XGBoost, and SVM.

Feel free to fit with more ML algorithms you like.

The best model with the lowest mean RMSE is Random Forest. 

I am more than happy to discuss more with this data and any thoughts!
